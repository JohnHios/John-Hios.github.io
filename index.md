### R/RShiny Projects 

[Productivity & Investment in the UK](/pdf/Deloitte_Investment_Project_JohnHios.pdf)
+ Used R for data wrangling and exploratory data analysis to visualize and identify significant patterns between productivity and investment for a range of countries, including the UK. 
+ The countries were grouped according to their productivity and investment in key assets and education via K-means clustering. 
+ Linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between UK productivity and investment in a historical context. 
+ The work scope was presented to an audience and reviewed by CodeClan instructors.

[New York Citi Bikes](/sample_page.md)
+ Used R for data cleaning/wrangling and exploratory data analysis on the NYC Bike share program data for 2018. 
+ Summary statistics, time series patterns and visualisations were generated with an aim to gain insights for increasing bike hires. 
+ The outcomes were reviewed by the CodeClan instructors in a 1-to-1 presentation.

[Winter Crisis Data](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
+ Collaborated on the development of an R Shiny dashboard using data from Public Health Scotland (PHS) to assess the: 
    + impact of winter on the acute hospital sector
    + effects of the recent pandemic from 2020 onwards 
+ The dashboard outlined the topic from a temporal, geographic and a demographic standpoint by evaluating: 
    + hospital capacity 
    + demographics 
    + bed availability/occupancy 
    + variation per admission type 
+ The work was presented to an audience and reviewed by CodeClan instructors.

[Meteorite Landings](http://example.com/)
+ Performed data cleaning, wrangling and exploratory data analysis to gain insights and provide visualisations on a comprehensive data set from NASA containing information on all known meteorite landings found up to year 2013. 
+ R was used to read data from a PostgreSQL database and carry out the analysis. 
+ Results were reviewed by the CodeClan instructors.

[Palmer Penguins](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
+ Performed exploratory data analysis, targeted data analysis via hypothesis testing, and generated summary statistics on penguin data collected at the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER (member of the Long-Term Ecological Research Network). 
+ The analysis was carried out in R and results were reviewed by the CodeClan instructors
